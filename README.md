**About**
Ultimate List is a meticulously organized repository of lists, providing a broad range of resources across various topics, designed to help you find valuable information quickly and efficiently.

The big emphasis is on providing more information than just a list.

We found a lot of lists on Github but nothing that gave us a mini-review of sorts to tell us if the thing that's listed is worth our time. Ultimate Lists focus on quality, not quantity.

**Creating a list:** Coming up
