**About**:<br>
Ultimate List is a meticulously organized repository of lists, providing a broad range of resources across various topics, designed to help you find valuable information quickly and efficiently.

The big emphasis is on providing more information than just a list.

We found a lot of lists on Github but nothing that gave us a mini-review to tell us if the thing that's listed is worth our time. Ultimate Lists is an Open Source attempt to cut through a bit of noise
</br><br>
**Creating a list:** Coming up
